# zot

a thingy to retrive stuff from zenless zone zero

it most definitely does not stand for zenless optimizer thingy... whatever would give you that idea...

## making this work

im not entirely sure but you should be able to just do um

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=./vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
```

and then pray that it works

if it doesnt work then idk man
